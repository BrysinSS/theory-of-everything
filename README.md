# Theory of Everything — A Unified Quantum Gravitational Model

This repository contains the original work by **Stanislav Brysin**, proposing a unified theoretical framework that integrates quantum mechanics and general relativity through a single wave functional Ψ[𝒜].

## 🌌 About the Theory

- Describes the universe via a wave functional Ψ[𝒜] defined over generalized gauge connections.
- Unifies geometry (spacetime) and internal symmetries (forces) in a single geometric-quantum structure.
- Builds on concepts from Loop Quantum Gravity, String Theory, and Gauge Theory.
- Predicts experimentally observable quantum-gravitational effects.
- Emergent spacetime and classicality arise from quantum coherence.
